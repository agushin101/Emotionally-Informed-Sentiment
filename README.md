# Emotionally-Informed-Sentiment
This project aims to improve sentiment analysis by taking into consideration the "emotional charge" of a word when calculating its weight.
The goal is to minimize accuracy loss while reducing the space required to store the data used to train the model. I find that properly
selecting "words to keep" allows for reasonable accuracies while significantly reducing the number of words needed to train the model.

All my experiments are run using the following Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/emotion-dataset
